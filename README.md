# Chat-bot-final
 The final chat-bot created for IIS project by group 6


This chatbot is made for a locally hosted database, the database may be easilly changed to work on a server hosted one with support for local data storage, currently it assume a local database of mongoDB is hosted on the port: mongodb://localhost:27018 (the database part requires some cleaning but can be easily done with just a different location of storing database memory)


The main file is temp.py instead of main.py due to some pending improvment changes

the required files are requirment.txt
